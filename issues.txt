The main issue that I had with implementing the experiment was with the
\textit{blur\_by\_pixel} algorithm, specifically the deployment of all the 
threads.\\
As mentioned in the description of the algorithm, \textit{blur\_by\_pixel} sometimes needs to stop
midway and allow previous threads to finish and join on them. This comes due to
the process running out of available threads.\\
To mittigate this issue, yet still allow for parallelism, I have used the
pthread\_tryjoin\_np function.\\
What differentiates it from the normal pthread\_join is that it does not block
the current thread. If the callee thread did not finish
execution, the function will just skip, without blocking the caller.\\
The way in which I am using this function inside \textit{blur\_by\_pixel} is, 
when a thread spawn fails, it calls pthread\_tryjoin\_np on all the threads that were
dispatched previously. This way, blur\_by\_pixel manages to free sufficient
resources to continue running in parallel, while not degrading into a
sequential algorithm.\\
